# IdeaUp

Evaluate the *economics* of a startup idea — market size, unit economics,
profitability, runway, validation, and risk — from a small set of assumptions.
The tool does not predict success. It scores the quality of your current
assumptions and tells you what to fix, validate, or test next.

**Few inputs → useful derived metrics → transparent score → clear risks → actionable next steps.**

## Architecture

The app is a Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui project.
Business logic is kept entirely out of React components:

```text
/src
  /app                     Routes: landing, sign-in, wizard, project workspace
                           (dashboard + business documents), projects, compare,
                           settings, OAuth consent, /api (projects CRUD),
                           /mcp (hosted MCP server), /health
  /components
    /ui                    shadcn/ui primitives
    /forms                 Multi-step wizard, field components, form <-> domain mapping
    /dashboard             Score, metrics, insights, sensitivity, scenarios, charts
    /documents             Generated business-document primitives (one-pager, pitch, …)
    /auth                  Sign-in and OAuth consent forms
    /audience              Investor / lender audience views
    /settings              MCP connection management
    /i18n                  Translation provider and helpers
    /layout                Header
  /lib
    /calculations          Pure financial calculation engine (TAM/SAM/SOM, CAC, LTV,
                           break-even, forecasting, scenarios, Monte Carlo, sensitivity)
    /scoring               Scoring engine: benchmarks, category scorers, confidence,
                           validation maturity
    /insights              Deterministic insight + decision-summary generation
    /projects              Supabase-backed repository, codec, safe mutations
    /storage               ProjectRepository interface + localStorage implementation
    /supabase              Browser/server clients and env detection
    /mcp                   MCP server: composition root, tool modules, pure
                           payload views, typed errors, OAuth auth, rate limiting
    /documents             Document registry, derivation, status
    /export                Project export/import
    /investor, /lender     Investor summary and lender assessment logic
    /validation            Zod schemas for the wizard and stored documents
    format.ts              Currency/percentage/multiple/month formatting helpers
    example.ts             Pre-populated example project
  /messages                English + Arabic message catalogs
  /types                   Domain types: Project, *Assumptions, CalculatedMetrics,
                           ScoreBreakdown, ForecastMonth, ScenarioResult, …
```

Every calculation is a pure function of typed inputs — no React, no I/O — and is
unit tested independently of the UI (see [Testing](#testing)).

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # start the dev server on http://localhost:3000
npm run test     # run the vitest suite
npm run lint     # eslint
npm run build    # production build (also runs the TypeScript compiler)
```

Out of the box in development — with no environment variables — the app runs
fully client-side and stores projects in the browser's `localStorage`.
Production fails closed when Supabase or project encryption is not configured;
it never silently falls back to browser storage.

To enable accounts and cross-device storage, point the app at a
[Supabase](https://supabase.com) project:

1. Create a Supabase project.
2. Apply the SQL files in `/supabase/migrations/` in timestamp order
   (SQL editor or `supabase db push`).
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your project URL and
   publishable key.

Once those variables are set, projects are stored in Postgres per
authenticated user. The substantive `projects.data` payload is encrypted by
the application before it reaches Postgres when `PROJECT_ENCRYPTION_MODE` is
`required`; project names and operational metadata remain readable. See
[docs/hosted-mcp-setup.md](docs/hosted-mcp-setup.md)
for deploying the optional hosted MCP server.

## Calculation formulas

All formulas live in `/src/lib/calculations` as small, single-purpose modules.
The most important ones, verbatim:

| Metric | Formula | Module |
|---|---|---|
| TAM | Total Potential Customers × Average Annual Customer Spend | `market.ts` |
| SAM | TAM × Addressable Market % | `market.ts` |
| SOM | SAM × Obtainable Market % | `market.ts` |
| Required penetration | Target Customers / Addressable Customers | `market.ts` |
| MRR | Monthly Customers × Monthly ARPU | `pricing.ts` |
| ARR | MRR × 12 | `pricing.ts` |
| CAC | (Marketing Spend + Sales Spend) / New Customers | `acquisition.ts` |
| Customer lifetime (months) | 1 / Monthly Churn Rate | `retention.ts` |
| Gross margin | Gross Profit / Revenue | `unitEconomics.ts` |
| LTV | Monthly ARPU × Gross Margin % / Monthly Churn Rate | `unitEconomics.ts` |
| LTV:CAC | LTV / CAC | `unitEconomics.ts` |
| CAC payback (months) | CAC / Monthly Gross Profit Per Customer | `unitEconomics.ts` |
| Monthly burn | max(0, Operating Expenses − Revenue) | `opex.ts` |
| Runway (months) | Available Cash / Monthly Burn | `funding.ts` |
| Break-even customers | Fixed Monthly Costs / Contribution Margin Per Customer | `breakeven.ts` |
| Break-even revenue | Break-even Customers × ARPU | `breakeven.ts` |

**Edge cases** (zero churn, zero CAC, zero revenue, negative contribution margin,
already-profitable businesses, one-time/annual/usage-based billing) are handled
explicitly in each module — see `helpers.ts` (`safeDiv`, `finiteOrZero`) and the
accompanying `__tests__` files. The UI never renders `NaN`, `Infinity`, or
`undefined`; `/src/lib/format.ts` guards every formatter.

Forecasts (`forecast.ts`, `projectForecast.ts`) generate a month-by-month
projection (customers, MRR, revenue, costs, cash balance) for any horizon;
12/24/36-month views and the scenario engine (`scenarios.ts`) all call the same
function with different inputs. The sensitivity engine (`sensitivity.ts`) flexes
price/CAC/churn/growth ±50% and re-runs the full scoring pipeline to rank which
assumptions move the score the most.

### Assumption ranges and Monte Carlo

Any numeric input can be entered either as a single number or as a range — low,
most likely, high — via the Range toggle on the input itself. A single number
("CAC = OMR 4,000") claims a precision nobody has; a range ("OMR 2,500–5,000,
most likely 4,000") states what is actually known.

`monteCarlo.ts` finds every ranged assumption in a project, draws each one from
a triangular distribution over its own low/most likely/high span, and re-runs
the full metrics + forecast + scoring pipeline once per draw (1,000 runs by
default, seeded from the project id so results are reproducible). It reports
the outcome as a distribution rather than a point forecast:

- probability of reaching break-even before cash runs out — the headline number
- probability of breaking even at all, and of running out of cash, in 24 months
- bear / base / bull columns read off the P10 / P50 / P90 of the simulated
  outcomes (each metric's own percentile, not one single run)
- the full distribution of break-even months, including runs that never get there

With no ranged assumptions there is nothing to sample, so the panel explains how
to add one instead of showing a fake distribution.

## Scoring methodology

`calculateScoreBreakdown()` in `/src/lib/scoring/index.ts` combines six category
scores (each 0-100) into one overall 0-100 score:

```text
Overall = Market × 20% + Unit Economics × 20% + Financial Viability × 20%
        + Validation × 15% + Execution × 15% + Risk × 10%
```

Each category (`/src/lib/scoring/{market,unitEconomics,financial,validation,execution,risk}.ts`)
documents exactly which inputs it considers and how they're weighted internally.
Scores are computed with `interpolateScore()` (`interpolate.ts`), which linearly
interpolates a metric value between named anchor points (e.g. LTV:CAC of 1x →
20/100, 3x → 68/100, 5x → 90/100) rather than generating arbitrary numbers — every
anchor is visible in source and in the "How this score is calculated" panel on
the dashboard.

Classification bands:

| Score | Label |
|---|---|
| 0–39 | High Risk |
| 40–54 | Weak |
| 55–69 | Promising |
| 70–84 | Strong |
| 85–100 | Very Strong |

## Business-model benchmarks

Gross margin, LTV:CAC, CAC payback, and churn benchmarks differ by business
model — a marketplace's healthy gross margin looks nothing like a SaaS
product's. `/src/lib/scoring/benchmarks.ts` exports:

```ts
const BUSINESS_MODEL_BENCHMARKS: Record<BusinessModel, BusinessModelBenchmarks> = {
  saas: { grossMarginPct: [...], ltvToCac: [...], cacPaybackMonths: [...], monthlyChurnPct: [...] },
  marketplace: { ... },
  ecommerce: { ... },
  service: { ... },
  one_time: { ... },
  // subscription and usage_based currently alias saas; "other" aliases service
};
```

**To tune a benchmark**, edit the anchor points for that business model in
`benchmarks.ts` — each array is `[metricValue, score]` pairs; no other file
needs to change. To add a new business model, add it to the `BusinessModel`
union in `/src/types/index.ts`, add a benchmark set here, and add an option to
`BUSINESS_MODEL_OPTIONS` in `/src/lib/constants.ts`.

## Confidence vs. viability

The **viability score** evaluates whether the economics work *given the
numbers entered*. The **confidence score** (`/src/lib/scoring/confidence.ts`,
0-100%) is a separate axis measuring how much real evidence backs those
numbers — the share of inputs marked "Known" vs. "Estimated" vs. "Unknown",
plus demonstrated validation evidence (interviews, users, paying customers,
LOIs) and whether CAC/churn are based on real data. A project can score 85 on
viability and 30% on confidence if the inputs are mostly guesses — the
dashboard always shows both, deliberately not conflated into one number.

**Validation maturity** (`/src/lib/scoring/maturity.ts`, Stage 0–5: Idea →
Problem Validated → Solution Validated → Revenue Validated → Growth Validated →
Scale Ready) is a third, independent signal — it does not feed the viability
score.

## Persistence

All persistence goes through the `ProjectRepository` interface
(`/src/lib/storage/types.ts`):

```ts
interface ProjectRepository {
  getAll(): Promise<Project[]>;
  getById(id: string): Promise<Project | null>;
  save(project: Project): Promise<void>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

The implementation is chosen at runtime (`/src/lib/storage/browserRepository.ts`):

- **No Supabase env vars in development** → `LocalStorageProjectRepository` —
  everything stays in the browser. Production instead fails closed.
- **Supabase configured** → a thin client that calls the app's own
  `/api/projects` routes. Those routes use `SupabaseProjectRepository`
  (`/src/lib/projects/repository.ts`) with the signed-in user's token: projects
  are stored as encrypted JSONB envelopes protected by row-level security,
  writes go through
  an allowlisted mutation set (`/src/lib/projects/mutations.ts`), and saves use
  optimistic concurrency (`revision` checks) so concurrent edits conflict
  loudly instead of silently overwriting.

Because every page/component depends on the interface, not the
implementation, swapping the backend again requires no calling-code changes.

## Hosted MCP capabilities

The hosted MCP server (`/src/lib/mcp`, served at `/mcp`) exposes the same
engine the UI uses. `server.ts` only registers; every payload is built by a
pure function in `/src/lib/mcp/views` that takes a `Project` and returns data —
which is why they are unit tested without a server or a database.

Two capabilities are reachable **only** through MCP: Lender Mode
(`get_lender_assessment`) and Investor Mode (`get_investor_assessment`) have no
route in the app, and `debt.*` — the loan terms Lender Mode reads — has no
wizard step, so MCP is the only way to populate it.

Resources are `ideaup://projects`, `ideaup://example`,
`ideaup://benchmarks/{business_model}`, and
`ideaup://projects/{id}/{kind}` where `kind` is any stored section plus
`summary`, `assumptions`, `analysis`, `financial_model`, `lender`, `investor`,
and `documents`. Ten prompts cover challenging assumptions, prioritising
validation, unit economics, founder review, comparison, investor readiness,
lender underwriting, downside risk, document drafting, and filling unknowns.

Writes stay off unless `MCP_WRITES_ENABLED=true`, the connection is in
read/write mode, and — for creation — the owner allowed it. See
[docs/hosted-mcp-setup.md](docs/hosted-mcp-setup.md) for deployment and
[docs/mcp-tools.md](docs/mcp-tools.md) for the client-facing contract.

## Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

228 vitest test cases cover the calculation engine (TAM/SAM/SOM, CAC, LTV,
LTV:CAC, gross margin, break-even, runway, forecasts, scenarios — including
zero-churn, zero-CAC, zero-revenue, and negative-margin edge cases), the
scoring engine (category boundaries, weight sums, worst-case/best-case
scores), the insights engine, and the formatting helpers. Financial
correctness is treated as more important than visual polish, per the project's
own principle.
