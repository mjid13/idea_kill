/**
 * Contradiction Detector — cross-checks assumptions that are entered in
 * different parts of the model and quietly disagree with each other:
 *
 * - `pricing.expectedCustomers12mo` vs the customer count the acquisition
 *   model actually projects at month 12 (the user says "6", the model says 5).
 * - `retention.averageCustomerLifetimeMonths` vs the lifetime the churn rate
 *   implies (a 2% churn and a 48-month lifetime cannot both be right).
 * - `market.averageAnnualCustomerSpend` vs the annualized price of the
 *   financial model (a TAM built on one ARPU and a forecast on another).
 * - CAC payback vs customer lifetime (customers who leave before they pay for
 *   their own acquisition — the economics contradict the retention story).
 * - Revenue-stream delivery costs vs the Unit Economics cost lines (the same
 *   infrastructure or support cost counted once inside `deliveryCostPct` and
 *   again per customer).
 *
 * Every rule reads the same derived metrics the rest of the report uses, so
 * the findings are reproducible and auditable — no AI. Messages/details are
 * translation keys with values travelling as params, matching the engine.
